# Picasso
PIC16F877A based 5V/20MHz development board and PIC programmer

**[!] This is a discontinued project in 2016.**

# Idea

Programming Microchip's PIC (_peripheral interface controller_)'s and preparing 
electronic circuit board takes time and also inconvenient in circuit testing process. 
In other words, using the appropriate PIC programmer and creating the proper circuit board according to
desired PIC's datasheet is not practical for situations that needs quick actions like prototyping.
In addition to that there is platforms like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc), so PIC is not preferable
except embedded applications.
Therefore, idea behind this project is creating a development board/prototyping platform using PIC.

# How?

[Sprut](https://www.sprut.de) is a project that aims to produce PIC programmer hardware with 
serial, parallel and USB techniques. 
(see [Brenner](http://www.sprut.de/electronic/pic/brenner/index.htm))
_Sprut Brenner_ is a preferred and common programmer board for universal PIC applications.
